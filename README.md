   - Form validations ensure proper format and unique entries.
   - Upon successful registration, user details are stored in local storage.

2. **Login Page**:
   - Users input their registered email and password to log in.
   - Validation checks email and password against the stored details.
   - Successful login redirects to the secured page; unsuccessful attempts show errors.
